# AutomatedFormFiller
This program uses Selenium to navigate to a specified Google Form when it is run. 
It then fills out the Google Form with the given information and then submits it.
Finally, it closes the tab.
This was created in order to quickly fill out a daily form given to my school's athletic teams.
